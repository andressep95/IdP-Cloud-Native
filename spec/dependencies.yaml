# Domain dependencies and interactions

dependencies:
  - source: users
    target: sessions
    type: command
    description: User deletion terminates active sessions
    coupling: medium
  
  - source: users
    target: audit
    type: event
    description: All user operations are logged
    coupling: loose
  
  - source: sessions
    target: users
    type: query
    description: Session validation checks user status
    coupling: tight

interaction_rules:
  - Domains communicate via events (preferred)
  - Synchronous calls only within bounded context
  - No circular dependencies allowed
  - Events must be idempotent
